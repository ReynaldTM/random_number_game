# random_number_game
Guess the number, and score a point.

This is my first project for Codecademy's Computer Science certificate which took me about two weeks to finish.  
I did want to make something else, but I felt that those were still some ways a way for me to realistically do it.  
So I made something simple and easy to make that uses the things I have recently learned like how to import and some 
basic git hub stuff.  I think it turned out fine although the score text could have been flushed out a bit more.
